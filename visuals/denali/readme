run command 'make' to generate executable file:  bulid.out


we have two input files for dataset GrQc:
 ./GrQc_ver_scalar.txt is scalar value file for vertices.
./GrQc_scalar_graph.txt is the edge file.
their format is here: http://denali.cse.ohio-state.edu/doc/pages/ctree.html#input-formats

run the follwoing command, you will generate the tree file 'GrQc.tree' :
./build.out ./GrQc_ver_scalar.txt ./GrQc_scalar_graph.txt ./GrQc.tree 

you need to use the software http://denali.cse.ohio-state.edu/doc/index.html to
visualize the tree file, and you will generate a 3D visualization like the picture 'tree.png'
